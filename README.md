# 01-edu Audit Tests

This repository contains audit test cases for all projects of **01-edu**. Each project has its own `.txt` file, which includes detailed test cases covering various scenarios and edge cases. These tests are intended to ensure the correctness and robustness of the projects.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- Each project has a corresponding `.txt` file named after the project.
- The `.txt` files contain a list of test cases for every aspect of the project, including expected inputs and outputs.
- The test cases are updated progressively.

### Example Structure:
```
/01-edu-audit-tests
    ├── project1.txt
    ├── project2.txt
    ├── project3.txt
    └── ...
```

## Projects

- The tests for a project are added only after I complete the project's implementation.
- Each file provides comprehensive test cases that cover:
  - Basic functionality
  - Edge cases
  - Performance-related cases, where applicable
